👋 Hi, I’m Vanesse Mngomezulu.

 🐱‍👤 I am  a website developer/designer that works with health and wellness coaches, consultants + specialists to help them become more visible online and make the impact they know they are meant to make.

😎 I  was previously a data science intern at Explore Data Science.

👩‍💻 I spend most of my time focused on web development and levelling up my skills, whilst spending weekends practising and upskilling on Machine Learning.

👩‍🎓 I might possibly be stuck in tutorial hell😖, but I'm learning Bootstrap 4. While spending my weekends learning Deep learning.

👯‍♀️🏄🏾‍♀️ I'm happy to work with other devs and designers.
